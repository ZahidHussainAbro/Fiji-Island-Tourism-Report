## Background
Fiji is the most developed island state in Oceania in terms of tourism. More than 300 islands are capturing the imagination, about 100 islands are inhabited by people, and the rest are uninhabited. The bulk of tourists come from Australia, followed by tourists from New Zealand, the USA, Canada, Europe, the UK, and the Asian region, including Japan. With the development of tourism, Fiji has created a large duty-free industry. For the perfect vacation, Fiji's tourism industry provides many affordable places to stay, from hostels to 5-star luxury hotels.


## 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲: to analyze the impact of Fiji’s tourism brand strategy on its economic performance. 
Specifically: 
- Define Fiji’s current tourism brand strategy. 
- Evaluate whether the strategy has been effective and explain your reasoning, supported by relevant data and statistics. 
- Provide suggestions for improving the client’s brand strategy to further stimulate the tourism sector.


## Data and Tools
This project was given by D2-Analytics (a sister company of Bloom Consulting). There was secondary data given, but primary data was taken from multiple sources. Applied data formatting, cleaning, validating, and statistical analysis before visualization. The Data Tool used is Excel. With due fact, the Data is limited due to unavailability. Similarly, a Used Pivot table is also for aggregations and visualizations.


## Results and Findings
𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘀: Yearly total number of arrivals (11,327,850) including tourists, business persons, holiday, etc, from 1999-2022.

𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Yearly total number of departures (11,005,532) including tourists, business persons, holidays, etc, from 1999-2022.

𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀: March 2023 (585.1 FJD M)

𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘀: (539,421)

𝗚𝗗𝗣 𝗶𝗻 𝗕𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: from 2009 to 2020, we can see that in 2009, GDP increased to 2018, then declined in 2020. This is the total GDP contributed by the Tourism sector.

𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗢𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗯𝘆 𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲: from 2000-2019, we can see occupancy increase in 2004-2005 just declined, then from 2009 it slightly increased, and in 2015 a little push, then drastically increased.
It's basically a comparison between bed-night occupancy and room-night occupancy.
Note: here, occupancy has a large contribution from staying in hotels and other residencies, etc.

𝗧𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁: We can see Australia, New Zealand, and the USA are among the largest numbers of tourists who visited the most Fiji islands, which gives a  clear picture to promote more and create new adventures, or work more on existing areas.

𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆: We can see holidays and visiting friends/relatives. By understanding the right potential category, we can optimize the expenditure by creating different strategic plans and new innovations.


## Recommendations:

𝗧𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁: Australia, New Zealand, and the USA are in largest number of tourists who visited the most Fiji islands, which gives a clear picture to promote more and create new adventures or work more on existing areas.

𝗧𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗿𝘆: Holidays and visiting friends/relatives. By understanding the right potential category, we can optimize the expenditure by creating different strategic plans and new innovations.

- Australia, New Zealand, and the USA on the top, but there is a seasonality difference in the UK, Europe, Canada, and Japan need more attention in creating new attractive visiting strategies if previous market campaign is runningn and no effective then reduce expenditure in those countries for specific seanal times but if the previous campagin is effective or increasing the number then spend in way that more vsistors can be attracted. 

- Except holiday and Friends/relatives category, all other total earning contributors need proper evaluation for branding to increase visitors. Less revenue generated except during holidays and the friends category, and by country except Australia, New Zealand, and the USA.

- There is also the geographical impact because of Australia, New Zealand, and the USA's large number of visitors, and they are close. Others are less because of geographical disadvantage. Expensive to afford for visitors from those countries. 
There can be a discount or any other program for visitors from these countries.

- Accommodation occupancy has slightly increased from 2016 to 2019, and needs 
In 2022, arrival number is slightly higher compared to departures, but overall comparison with other years shows a very small number of visitors, which is a negative rate of arrivals.

- Also in 2022 as compare to previous years, visitors stayed more than departed.

- Total arrivals and departures from 1999-2022 have 322,318 difference of which is in total, but yearly we can see an increase from 2002 to 2019, then a decrease in 2020 and 2021, which needs proper evaluation or root cause analysis.


𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹: Due to the no enough primary data, it was collected from different sources and we figured out how the Fiji strategy and branding impacted Fiiji tourism by understanding tourist arrivals, departures, and GDP, from which continent highest number of tourists, in which area there is potential to work on as branding or where should we invest more as per current or last performance either public or private branding or through more effective marketing channels and target groups where. We should spend on campaigns where target countries have a large number of visitors. We can also improve and create innovative solutions for 
attracting more tourists. 

## Excel Sheet Tasks:
Here I used query to split some regions by formulas and then performed calculations using excel std, var, mean etc. Additionally, conditional formatting using formula for increase and decrease No. of busineses with Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) etc.
